Tagalog App

Tagalog App, or "I love you pero" is an app that aims to help people learn Tagalog, the language of the Philippines.

Play:
  Play is a work in progress that aims to be a game that turns tagalog education into a game with stages. It will involve a part of the game which is a story with animations that play or skip on click, animations which are played and ended for you, and animations that overlap on top of other animations rendered by the browser.

  It will also include a part of the game much like our App MVP that asks the player questions about tagalog from one of the characters aiding the Main character in the game.

  The Game is a work in progress and will not be done for quite some time.

App MVP:
  The usable App that teaches you some tagalog words and asks you to repeat them. It is essentially a slideshow app with Language learning elements.

Log in:
  Will play into accounts when playing the main game once completed.
